# BingoSyncSharp
A simple C# [BingoSync](https://bingosync.com/) API interactor, for easy interactions with [BingoSync](https://bingosync.com/) rooms.

## About the creation of BingoSyncSharp
Firstly, a question to myself that must be answered clearly:
- Q: **Am I the right person to make something like this?**
- A: **No**. I only started learning C# 9 to 10 months ago (December of 2023) and did my best to even learn web interactions with C# only **3 weeks ago** (August of 2024). I am not the right person to make this, but needed a way to interact with [BingoSync](https://bingosync.com/) for a [plugin](https://github.com/Ninja-Cookie/TrueBingo) I was creating, and could not find an easy and simple way to interact with BingoSync using C# anywhere else, so I made one.

I still think what I have made is good, but I also simply don't have the experience or know-how to know what "good" is, and wanted to be transparent about that.

## How to use BingoSyncSharp
Simply add `BingoSyncSharp.dll` (from one of the [releases](https://github.com/Ninja-Cookie/BingoSyncSharp/releases/)) as a reference in your project. You can also place `BingoSyncSharp.xml` with the DLL, for added documentation in the code on what things do and how they can be used.
